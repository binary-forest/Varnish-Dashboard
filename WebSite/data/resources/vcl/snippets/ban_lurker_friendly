#The following is some VCL to help write ban lurker friendly bans

#The ban lurker can help you keep the ban list at a manageable size, it is recommend that you avoid using req.* in your bans,
#as the request object is not available in the ban lurker thread.

    if (client.ip !~ purge) {
      error 401 "Not allowed";
    }
    ban("obj.http.x-url ~ " + req.url); # Assumes req.url is a regex. This might be a bit too simple
